# Employee Directory

App deployed at [https://vast-meadow-58189.herokuapp.com/](https://vast-meadow-58189.herokuapp.com/)

## Description

An app for displaying, sorting, and filtering an employee list.  The list can be sorted in ascending or descending order by clicking on the column headings for employee name, department, and hire date.  The list is filtered by your search term as you type (with a debounce delay) to show all employee records that contain the search term within any of their data fields.

## Technologies Used

This app was created using React, using a combination of stateful and stateless components.

Moment.js is used for date formatting.

## Opportunities for Future Development

This app could obviously be paired with some of my previous apps that provide for employee record management and db storage, dynamic creation of html pages from employee records, etc. to create a more fully-featured app.  If those other apps had been created as React components, that would probably be pretty easy to do!
